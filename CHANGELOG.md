# Changelog

All notable changes to ESP-KVM are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and the project aims to follow
semantic versioning while it is pre-1.0 (a new feature bumps the minor, a fix
bumps the patch).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- A network firmware update could come up reachable and then be rolled back on
  the next reset. The image was confirmed only after every peripheral had
  started, so a USB or capture block left in a bad state by the warm restart
  kept the confirmation from being reached. The image is now confirmed the
  moment the network and web server answer - the point at which the device is
  re-flashable - and the warm-reset-prone peripherals start afterwards, where a
  failure degrades the device instead of reverting it. Boot phases are logged
  so a future failure is diagnosable from the serial console.

### Added
- **Target-OS awareness.** The device guesses whether the target is Windows,
  macOS, Linux or Android from how it enumerates USB, and shows the guess (with
  the raw fingerprint) next to the USB status and in Settings. A `Target OS`
  setting overrides it when the guess is wrong or unknown.
- The console tailors input to that OS: it labels the Meta key Win, Cmd or
  Super, and offers OS-specific key combinations - the Linux magic-SysRq
  sequences **REISUB** (safely reboot a hung machine) and **REISUO** (safely
  power it off), and **Ctrl+Alt+F1-F6** to switch virtual terminals.
- **Built-in rescue media.** A small bootable image - iPXE, memtest, a DOS
  floppy - can be kept in a 4 MB flash partition and served to the target over
  the same USB drive as the card's files, with no microSD needed. Unlike the
  card, it can be written from the console, because this board's flash writes are
  reliable where its SD writes are not. Upload it in the virtual-media tab and
  pick it as the active medium; the card and the rescue image coexist.

### Changed
- The set of USB functions is now built into the descriptor at start-up instead
  of being fixed, so mass storage can be left out to free its endpoints (room a
  future USB-network interface can use). **Expose virtual media** now controls
  whether the USB drive is present at all and takes effect after a restart; with
  it off the device is a plain keyboard and mouse. Swapping the image once the
  drive exists still takes effect immediately.
- The partition table gains a 4 MB `rescue` partition, appended so every existing
  offset is unchanged. A device adopts it with a one-time full flash over cable
  (the browser flasher works); it cannot be taken on by an over-the-network
  update.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-07-24

### Changed
- Board wiring is now configured in `menuconfig` instead of a hardcoded header:
  the microSD pins and slot power-gate, the TC358743 I2C pins and reference
  clock, and the BOOT button GPIO joined the Ethernet pins that were already
  there, all with the Waveshare ESP32-P4-ETH values as defaults. Porting to
  another ESP32-P4 board is now a menuconfig edit; set the button or SD
  power-gate GPIO to `-1` on a board that lacks them. No behaviour change on
  the reference board - the binary is identical. See `docs/PORTING.md`.

### Added
- `docs/PORTING.md` - adapting the firmware to another ESP32-P4 board.
- `AGENTS.md` - repo conventions, build/flash commands and hard-won gotchas,
  for contributors and AI coding agents.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-24

### Added
- **Virtual media.** A disk image on the microSD card is presented to the target
  as a read-only USB drive it can boot from - a rescue system, an installer, a
  live image. The console gains a media tab to list the images on the card and
  choose which one the target sees.

### Notes / known limits
- The card is served **read-only**: this board cannot write the microSD
  reliably, so images are prepared in an external card reader. Upload and delete
  in the console are disabled with the device's own explanation.
- The card must be **FAT32**; a single image is capped at 4 GB (a FAT32 limit).
- microSD reads run at 4 MHz (~1.5 MB/s). Higher clocks fail every multi-block
  read on this board - a known ESP32-P4 SD limitation - so booting a heavy
  graphical image is slow (minutes); a minimal rescue image boots in about a
  minute. The card mount is retried at boot; a marginal card may need reseating.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-07-23

Foundation releases. The core KVM: HDMI capture with automatic mode following,
MJPEG and hardware H.264 streaming, an absolute and relative USB pointer and a
full keyboard, the Vue web console, HTTPS with a self-signed certificate,
login with a physical password reset, thermal protection, and firmware update
over the network with rollback. microSD is mounted and reported (the base the
virtual-media feature above builds on).

## [0.1.1] - 2026-07-23

First tagged build: the release pipeline (GitHub Actions), the update manifest
on GitHub Pages, and the browser flasher.
